          Hello! My name is Aastha Shrestha, and I am a web developer with a passion
          for creating interactive and responsive websites. With a background in
          both design and programming, I aim to build web applications that are
          not only visually appealing but also highly functional.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been in the web development industry for over 5 years, working
          on a wide range of projects from small business websites to
          large-scale web applications. My expertise includes HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, and various modern frameworks like React and Node.js.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I enjoy learning new technologies, contributing to
          open-source projects, and exploring the latest trends in the tech
          world.
